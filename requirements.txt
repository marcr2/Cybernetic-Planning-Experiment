# GUI and real-time map functionality
# =====================================
# This section includes dependencies for the enhanced GUI with integrated
# real-time map visualization. The map functionality provides:
# - Interactive map generation using Folium
# - Real-time map updates during simulation
# - Integrated map preview within the GUI
# - External browser integration for full interactivity
# - Dynamic map statistics and element tracking
# - Native image display using Pillow (PIL)
# - Automatic map image generation using Selenium
# - Scrollable map interface with mouse wheel support
#
# Note: The following modules are built-in with Python and don't require installation
# tkinter - GUI framework for the main application interface
# webbrowser - For opening maps in external browser
# subprocess - For system process management
# platform - For cross-platform compatibility
# threading - For real-time map updates
# tempfile - For temporary file handling

# INSTALLATION NOTES
# =============================================================================
# To install all dependencies for the Cybernetic Planning System, run:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# For virtual environment setup:
#   python -m venv .venv
#   .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
#   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - For map image generation, you need Chrome browser installed for Selenium
# - The ECOS solver is required for optimization (fixes CVXPY warnings)
# - Pillow (PIL) is required for image display in the GUI
# - All dependencies are compatible with Python 3.9+
#
# Optional dependencies:
# - Chrome/Chromium browser for Selenium (map image generation)
# - Development tools (pytest, black, flake8, etc.) for contributors
#
# The system includes core functionality for economic planning with enhanced
# map visualization features including native image display and scrolling.
