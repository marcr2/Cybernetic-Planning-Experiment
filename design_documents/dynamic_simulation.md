# Socialist Planned Economy Simulation Environment - Technical Requirements

## Core Objective
Create a comprehensive economic simulation system that can test socialist planned economy strategies in dynamically generated environments with realistic constraints and stochastic events.

## System Architecture Requirements

### 1. Dynamic Environment Generation

#### Multi-layer Map System
Generate overlapping map layers representing different aspects of the simulation world:
- Geographic features (water bodies, mountains, plains)
- Settlement distribution (cities, towns, rural areas)
- Economic zones (industrial, agricultural, resource extraction)
- Infrastructure networks (roads, railways, utilities)

#### Procedural Generation Parameters
- Number and size of economic sectors
- Population density distribution
- Natural resource availability and location
- Terrain difficulty coefficients
- Climate zones and weather patterns

### 2. Infrastructure and Transportation System

#### Pathfinding Algorithm
Implement optimal route calculation between settlements:
- Consider terrain costs (mountains, water crossings, etc.)
- Factor in infrastructure development costs
- Dynamic road/railway network optimization

#### Transport Cost Calculation
- Distance-based costs using metric system (kilometers)
- Terrain multipliers for different ground types
- Mode-specific efficiency (road vs. rail vs. water)
- Cargo capacity and speed constraints

### 3. Socialist Economic Planning Engine

#### Central Planning System
- **Production Quotas**: Centrally determined output targets for all sectors
- **Resource Allocation**: State-directed distribution of materials and labor
- **Five-Year Plan Integration**: Long-term strategic planning cycles
- **Priority Sectors**: Weighted importance for essential industries (healthcare, education, defense, basic needs)

#### Resource Management System
- **State Stockpile Tracking**: Centralized inventory management for all resources
- **Production Chains**: Multi-stage manufacturing coordinated by central planning
- **Distribution Planning**: Needs-based allocation rather than market-driven
- **Resource Categories**: Raw materials, intermediate goods, finished products, public services

#### Population and Labor Management
- **Workforce Allocation**: Planned assignment of labor to different sectors
- **Education and Training**: State-directed skill development programs
- **Full Employment Goals**: Planned job creation and placement
- **Social Services**: Public healthcare, education, housing provision

### 4. Time Management System

- **Temporal Resolution**: Month-by-month simulation steps
- **Production Cycles**: Different industries with varying production timeframes
- **Planning Periods**: Annual and five-year plan implementations
- **Seasonal Effects**: Agricultural cycles, weather-dependent activities

### 5. Stochastic Event System

#### Natural Disasters
- **Weather Events**: Tornadoes, floods, droughts, hurricanes
- **Geological Events**: Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions
- **Biological Events**: Pandemics, crop diseases, pest infestations
- **Impact Modeling**: Damage to infrastructure, production capacity, population

#### Socialist Economy-Specific Disruptions
- **Production Bottlenecks**: Supply chain coordination failures
- **Resource Shortages**: Raw material scarcity affecting planned production
- **Infrastructure Failures**: Transport network disruptions
- **Demographic Shifts**: Population movements, aging workforce
- **Technological Challenges**: Equipment failures, maintenance backlogs
- **Administrative Issues**: Planning coordination problems, bureaucratic delays
- **External Pressures**: Trade embargoes, resource access restrictions
- **Climate Events**: Long-term environmental changes affecting agriculture/industry

### 6. Socialist Planning Mechanisms

#### Central Coordination Systems
- **Input-Output Tables**: Detailed tracking of inter-industry dependencies
- **Material Balance Planning**: Ensuring supply equals demand for all goods
- **Investment Allocation**: State-directed capital formation and infrastructure development
- **Regional Coordination**: Balancing development across different areas

#### Performance Metrics
- **Plan Fulfillment**: Achievement of production and distribution targets
- **Social Indicators**: Healthcare access, education levels, housing quality
- **Equality Measures**: Income distribution, regional development balance
- **Sustainability Metrics**: Resource conservation, environmental protection

### 7. Adaptive Systems

#### Dynamic Growth Modeling
- **Socialist Innovation**: State-directed R&D and technology development
- **Infrastructure Expansion**: Planned capacity growth based on social needs
- **Human Development**: Education and skill advancement programs
- **Quality of Life**: Social services affecting productivity and satisfaction

#### Socialist Feedback Loops
- **Plan Performance → Resource Reallocation**: Adjusting inputs based on output results
- **Social Needs → Production Priorities**: Demand-driven planning adjustments
- **Population Welfare → Labor Productivity**: Worker satisfaction affecting output
- **Regional Development → Population Distribution**: Planned settlement patterns

### 8. Data Standards and Measurement

- **Metric System**: All measurements in kilometers, kilograms, liters, etc.
- **Standardized Units**: Consistent measurement across all subsystems
- **Socialist Performance Indicators**: Plan fulfillment rates, social development metrics
- **Data Export**: Comprehensive planning and performance analysis tools

### 9. Testing Framework

#### Socialist Planning Scenarios
- **Baseline Testing**: 5-year plan simulation with normal conditions
- **Crisis Response**: Natural disaster and production disruption scenarios
- **Development Strategy**: Comparing different socialist development approaches
- **Resource Optimization**: Testing efficient allocation mechanisms

#### Success Criteria for Socialist Economy
- **Plan Target Achievement**: Meeting production and distribution goals
- **Social Welfare Improvement**: Healthcare, education, housing quality advances
- **Full Employment**: Job provision for all capable workers
- **Regional Balance**: Equitable development across different areas
- **Sustainability**: Long-term resource and environmental stewardship
- **Crisis Resilience**: Ability to maintain essential services during disruptions

## Implementation Considerations

### Socialist-Specific Features
- **Democratic Planning Tools**: Worker and community input mechanisms
- **Cooperative Management**: Integration of worker collectives and state enterprises
- **Public Service Priority**: Essential services maintained regardless of "profitability"
- **Long-term Sustainability**: Environmental and resource conservation emphasis

### Performance Requirements
- Complex planning algorithm optimization
- Real-time coordination across multiple sectors
- Large-scale data processing for comprehensive planning
- Scenario modeling for long-term strategic planning

### User Interface
- Central planning dashboard and control systems
- Production and distribution monitoring tools
- Social indicator tracking and visualization
- Plan modification and adjustment interfaces

### Extensibility
- Different socialist economic models (Soviet, Yugoslav, Cuban, etc.)
- Various democratic planning mechanisms
- Customizable social priority weighting systems
- Integration with ecological and sustainability models

**Note**: This system should provide a robust testing environment for socialist planned economy strategies by simulating the coordination challenges, resource allocation decisions, and social priorities that characterize socialist economic planning while accounting for real-world constraints and disruptions.
