# Cybernetic Central Planning Software Development Specification (Expanded)

## Project Overview

Develop an AI-enhanced central planning software system that generates
comprehensive 5-year economic plans. The system will be founded on the
principles of cybernetic economic planning, integrating the Input-Output
models of Wassily Leontief with the labor-time accounting and computational
methods proposed by W. Paul Cockshott and Allin Cottrell. The core of the
system will be a deterministic algorithm engine that solves for physical
production targets, which is then refined and iterated upon by a multi-agent
AI system to align the plan with complex social and political goals.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Input Processing

- **Primary Input**: A set of Input-Output (I-O) tables. This must be
  parsable into several core matrices:
  - **Technology Matrix ($A$)**: A square matrix of size $n \times n$,
    where $n$ is the number of distinct economic sectors/products. The
    element $A_{ij}$ represents the units of input from sector $i$
    required to produce one unit of output for sector $j$.
  - **Final Demand Vector ($d$)**: A column vector of size $n \times 1$.
    This represents the desired final output of goods and services for
    consumption, government spending, and net exports. This vector is the
    primary target for the plan.
  - **Direct Labor Input Vector ($l$)**: A row vector of size
    $1 \times n$. The element $l_j$ represents the amount of direct labor
    time (e.g., in person-hours) required to produce one unit of output
    for sector $j$.
- **Secondary Input**: User-defined political and social goals in natural
  language (e.g., "reduce carbon emissions by 20%," "increase healthcare
  capacity by 15%," "ensure a minimum provision of 2,200 calories per
  capita").
- **Tertiary Input**: Constraint data, including:
  - **Resource Constraint Matrix ($R$)**: An $m \times n$ matrix where
    $R_{kj}$ is the amount of primary resource $k$ (e.g., tons of steel,
    liters of water) required per unit of output from sector $j$.
  - **Maximum Resource Vector ($R_{max}$)**: A column vector of size
    $m \times 1$ specifying the total availability of each primary resource.
- **Output**: Comprehensive 5-year economic plan in markdown format.

### 2. Algorithmic Foundation

The core algorithm engine must implement the following mathematical models:

#### a. Static Leontief Model (Year 1 Plan)

The fundamental calculation determines the **Total Output Vector ($x$)**
required to produce a given **Final Demand Vector ($d$)**.

- **Governing Equation**: The economy is described by the linear equation:
  $$x = Ax + d$$
  where $x$ is the total gross output, $Ax$ represents the intermediate
  demand (goods consumed by other industries), and $d$ is the final demand.

- **Solution**: The required total output is found by solving for $x$:
  $$(I - A)x = d$$
  $$x = (I - A)^{-1} d$$
  The engine must be capable of calculating the **Leontief Inverse Matrix**,
  $(I - A)^{-1}$, using standard numerical methods for matrix inversion
  (e.g., Gaussian elimination, LU decomposition). The implementation must
  be robust to handle large, sparse matrices, as real-world I-O tables can
  have thousands of sectors.

#### b. Labor Value Calculation

Following Cockshott's model, the plan should use labor time as a
fundamental, invariant measure of cost.

- **Labor Value Equation**: The **Labor Value Vector ($v$)**,
  representing the total direct and indirect labor embodied in one unit
  of each product, is calculated by solving the following system:
  $$v = vA + l$$
  This states that the value of a commodity ($v$) is the sum of the value
  transferred from its inputs ($vA$) and the new value added by direct
  labor ($l$).

- **Solution**: The vector of labor values is:
  $$v(I - A) = l$$
  $$v = l(I - A)^{-1}$$
  This calculation reuses the Leontief Inverse, making it computationally
  efficient. The total labor cost for the entire plan is then the dot
  product $L = v \cdot d$.

#### c. Constrained Optimization

The initial plan generated by the Leontief model must be validated and
adjusted against physical and social constraints. This transforms the
problem into a constrained optimization task, solvable with **Linear
Programming (LP)**.

- **Objective Function**: The primary objective is to minimize the total
  labor time required to produce the target final demand.
  $$\text{Minimize} \ L = l \cdot x$$

- **Constraints**:
  1. **Demand Fulfillment**: The plan must produce *at least* the final
     demand.
      $$(I - A)x \ge d$$
  2. **Resource Limits**: The total consumption of primary resources must
     not exceed availability.
      $$Rx \le R_{max}$$
  3. **Non-Negativity**: It is impossible to produce a negative quantity
     of any good.
      $$x \ge 0$$

The algorithm engine should use an LP solver (e.g., Simplex algorithm,
Interior Point method) to find the optimal $x$ that satisfies these
conditions.

#### d. Dynamic Planning (Years 2-5)

The 5-year plan must account for growth and technological change. This
requires a dynamic model.

- **Dynamic Equation**: The final demand vector $d$ is split into
  consumption ($d_c$) and investment ($d_i$). The investment goods are
  used to expand the capital stock.
  $$x_t = A_t x_t + d_{c,t} + d_{i,t}$$
- **Capital Accumulation**: The capital stock in the next period
  ($K_{t+1}$) is a function of the current stock and investment.
  $$K_{t+1} = (I - \delta)K_t + d_{i,t}$$
  where $\delta$ is the depreciation rate matrix. The technology matrix $A$
  and labor vector $l$ may change over time ($A_t, l_t$) based on planned
  investment in new technologies. The plan for year $t+1$ will use an
  updated technology matrix $A_{t+1}$ derived from the investment decisions
  made for year $t$.

### 3. Multi-Agent AI Architecture

#### Agent Roles & Mathematical Focus

- **Manager AI**: Central coordinator. No direct mathematical role, but
  orchestrates the iterative refinement of the plan vectors ($x, d$) and
  constraint matrices ($A, R$).
- **Specialist AIs**:
  - **Economics AI**: Performs sensitivity analysis on the Leontief Inverse.
    For example, it calculates $\frac{\partial x}{\partial A_{ij}}$ to
    identify critical supply chains. It uses econometric models from the RAG
    system to forecast potential changes in the technology matrix ($A_t$)
    due to substitution effects or price changes (in a mixed-economy
    context).
  - **Resource & Environmental AI**: Focuses on the $Rx \le R_{max}$
    constraint. Uses the RAG to find data on resource stocks and pollution
    coefficients, adding new rows to the $R$ matrix (e.g., a row for CO2
    emissions per unit of output). It can suggest modifications to the $A$
    matrix (e.g., substitute a less resource-intensive input) or impose
    caps on specific sectoral outputs ($x_j$).
  - **Social Policy AI**: Translates qualitative goals into quantitative
    adjustments to the final demand vector $d$. For example, "improve
    healthcare" becomes a targeted percentage increase in the elements of
    $d$ corresponding to medical equipment, hospital construction, etc. It
    may also propose constraints, such as a minimum level of food
    production ($x_{\text{food}} \ge \text{min_calories} \times
    \text{population}$).
- **Writer AI**:
  - **Evaluation Function**: The approval score is not subjective. It is a
    weighted function of how well the final proposed plan ($x^*, d^*$) meets
    the quantified targets.
      $$\text{Score} = \sum_{k=1}^{N} w_k \cdot f(P_k, T_k)$$
      where $w_k$ is the weight of goal $k$, $P_k$ is the projected
      performance of the plan on that goal (e.g., total CO2 emissions),
      $T_k$ is the target for that goal, and $f$ is a scoring function
      (e.g., a normalized exponential function that heavily penalizes
      missing a target).

### 4. Data Integration & RAG System

The RAG system must be able to extract and structure data into the
specific matrix and vector formats required by the Algorithm Engine. This
includes:

- Parsing national I-O tables (e.g., from BEA, Eurostat) into the $A$ and
  $l$ matrices.
- Extracting time-series data for key physical indicators (e.g., energy
  production, steel output) to validate the plan's output vector $x$.
- Finding academic papers that provide coefficients for environmental or
  social impact models to populate the $R$ matrix.

### 5. Technical Specifications

#### Output Format

The markdown output must be mathematically transparent. It should include:

- **Executive Summary**: Key targets for $d$ and projected total labor
  cost $L$.
- **Sector-by-Sector Analysis**: A table listing the required gross output
  ($x_j$) for each sector $j$.
- **Resource Allocation**: A summary of the resource usage vector $Rx$ and
  a comparison with the resource availability vector $R_{max}$.
- **Labor Budget**: The labor value ($v_j$) for each commodity and the
  total labor allocation ($l_j x_j$) for each sector.
- **Risk Assessment**: A sensitivity analysis showing how changes in key
  coefficients of the $A$ matrix would affect the total output vector $x$.
