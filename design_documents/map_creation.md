  - Cargo capacity optimization and load balancing
  - Multi-modal transport coordination and transfers

### 2. Cargo Distribution Optimization

- Create automatic reorder points and safety stock calculations
- Track stockpile levels, turnover rates, and expiration/degradation

### 4. Infrastructure Network Generation
- **Terrain Analysis**: Implement terrain difficulty assessment for construction
- **Route Planning**: Create algorithms that favor easier construction paths (e.g., around mountains vs. through them)
- **Cost Modeling**: Factor construction difficulty into infrastructure costs
- **Network Types**: Generate both road and rail networks based on:
  - Topographical constraints
  - Population density
  - Economic importance of connections
  - Construction feasibility

### 5. City Generation and Connectivity
- **Urban Hierarchy**: Create different city sizes and importance levels
- **Regional Clustering**: Group cities into coherent regional networks
- **Connection Logic**: Ensure cities connect logically within regions rather than directly to all other cities
- **Growth Patterns**: Implement organic city development based on economic factors

### 6. Regional Economic Specialization
- **Sector Classification**: Define economic sectors (manufacturing, agriculture, services, etc.)
- **Regional Profiles**: Assign specialization values to each region for different sectors
- **Comparative Advantage**: Implement logic for regions to develop based on their strengths
- **Trade Dependencies**: Create inter-regional trade relationships based on specializations

### 7. Population and Quality of Life Simulation
- **Demographics**: Model population size, age distribution, and growth rates
- **Demand Modeling**: Calculate consumer demand based on population and income levels
- **Standard of Living**: Create metrics tied to:
  - Local stockpile availability
  - Production output
  - Infrastructure quality
  - Employment rates
- **Feedback Loops**: Implement correlations between stockpiles, production, and living standards

### 8. Natural Resource Management
- **Resource Types**: Implement various resource deposits:
  - Agricultural resources (grain, livestock, etc.)
  - Base metals (iron, copper, aluminum)
  - Precious metals (gold, silver)
  - Rare earth minerals
  - Energy resources (oil, coal, uranium)
- **Extraction Logic**: Model mining/harvesting operations with capacity constraints
- **Depletion Mechanics**: Resources should diminish over time with extraction

### 9. Dynamic Industry Management
- **Industry Types**: Define various industrial sectors and their requirements
- **Adaptive Restructuring**: Allow industries to shift based on:
  - Central planning directives
  - Resource availability changes
  - Market demand fluctuations
- **Transition Costs**: Model the time and resources required for industrial transitions
- **Worker Retraining**: Account for workforce adaptation during industry shifts

### 10. Adaptive Planning System
- **Condition Monitoring**: Continuously track key economic indicators
- **Deviation Detection**: Identify when actual outcomes diverge from planned targets
- **Plan Adjustment**: Implement algorithms to modify plans based on:
  - Resource shortages/surpluses
  - Infrastructure failures
  - Population changes
  - External economic shocks
- **Optimization Cycles**: Regular plan recalculation and improvement

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Structures
- Consider using graph structures for transportation networks
- Implement efficient spatial data structures for regional management
- Use time-series data structures for tracking changes over simulation time

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize pathfinding algorithms for large-scale networks
- Implement efficient update mechanisms for stockpile changes
- Consider parallel processing for independent regional calculations

### Integration Requirements
- All systems should interact through well-defined interfaces
- Ensure changes in one system properly propagate to dependent systems
- Maintain consistency between transportation, stockpiles, and regional economies

### 11. Bug Fix: Synthetic Data Generation Sector Count Issue
- **Critical Bug Fix Required**: Fix the existing bug in synthetic data generation where the system generates incorrect number of sectors
- **Problem Description**: 
  - User requests specific number of sectors (e.g., 300 sectors) during synthetic data generation
  - System only generates a fraction of requested sectors (e.g., only 15 sectors instead of 300)
- **Investigation Requirements**:
  - Identify where the sector count parameter is being lost or overridden
  - Check for loop termination conditions that exit early
  - Verify input validation isn't capping the sector count unexpectedly
  - Look for array/collection size limitations or initialization issues
- **Expected Fix Outcomes**:
  - System generates exactly the number of sectors requested by user
  - Maintain quality and distribution of generated sectors
  - Ensure fix doesn't break other aspects of synthetic data generation
  - Add validation to confirm correct sector count generation
- **Testing Requirements**:
  - Test with various sector counts (small: 10, medium: 100, large: 1000+)
  - Verify generated sectors maintain expected properties and relationships
  - Confirm memory usage scales appropriately with larger sector counts

### 12. Map Visualization and Integration
- **Existing Map System Assessment**: Analyze current map logic to determine:
  - Which components can be enhanced vs. need replacement
  - Compatibility with new simulation requirements
  - Performance limitations of existing system
- **Visual Layer Implementation**: Create visual representations for:
  - Transportation networks (roads, rails, flight paths) with capacity indicators
  - Resource deposits with extraction status and remaining quantities
  - Regional boundaries with economic specialization color coding
  - Stockpile locations with current inventory levels
  - City locations with size/importance indicators
  - Real-time cargo flows and transportation utilization
- **Interactive Elements**: Implement user interaction features:
  - Click-to-inspect functionality for cities, stockpiles, and transport routes
  - Zoom levels that show different detail granularity
  - Time-based playback controls for observing simulation progression
  - Planning interface for manual adjustments to the economic plan
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure visualization can handle:
  - Large-scale maps with hundreds of cities and regions
  - Real-time updates during simulation execution
  - Smooth rendering of dynamic elements (moving cargo, changing stockpiles)
- **Integration Strategy**: 
  - Maintain backward compatibility where possible with existing map features
  - Provide migration path for existing map data
  - Implement modular design allowing gradual replacement of legacy components
